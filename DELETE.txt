  To-Do List / Task Breakdown (from ChatGPT) - will delete as we complete things


3. Build the Server-Side Logic (Node.js/Express)
 Set up a basic Express server.

 Create routes for:

 Getting available topics/difficulties

 Getting a random unanswered question by topic and difficulty

 Submitting an answer and updating the document's answered status

 Checking the user's score and mistake count

 Checking whether the game is over

4. Client-Side JavaScript Logic
 On topic/difficulty selection:

 Check if unanswered questions remain.

 If none: show a message to choose a different topic.

 If available: fetch and display a question with 4 answers.

 When user selects an answer:

 Check if itâ€™s correct

 Show a message (correct / incorrect)

 Update score and mistake count

 Update answered field in the DB

 Display current score

 If 4 mistakes: end the game and show score

 If all questions are answered: show end game message and score

5. Game Logic
 Track:

Number of correct answers (points)

Number of incorrect answers (mistakes)

 Stop the game after:

4 mistakes, or

All questions are answered (answered = Y for all)

6. Final Preparation for Submission
 Write a brief document explaining how the app works.

 Add names of both team members on the cover page.

 Zip the entire project folder (code, CSV, explanation).

 Upload it to the course system (Lamada) before August 15, 2025.
