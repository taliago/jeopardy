package.json & package-lock.json:

GPT suggested that these 2 files are an essential part of any Node.js project.
 - package.json lists the project's dependencies and metadata.
 - package-lock.json locks the exact versions to ensure consistency across different environments.

Run " npm install " to install dependencies, 
make sure MongoDB is running, then do " npm start ".



Here is a to-do list, so we don't forget anything:

DONE: 
 - Server activation
 - Model\Schema of collection
 - Load docs from csv to db (loadQuestion.js)
 - Write HTML (index.html)
 - Accepts answer and says if correct, only counts a question Answered if the answer was correct (maybe
    we should change that?) - DONE. Now it counts all questions
 - In HTML - change color of (levels, subjects) depend on their availability
 - Now coloring is written in script (HTML), maybe we should do it in CSS
 - Ends the game when all answered
 - Added lives counter
 - Display reaction to the answer in HTML (not alert)
 - IMPORTANT! (Done, but better to check) Prevent game after 4 mistakes. Now you can continue following the link.
 - IMPORTANT: Separate Game Over for victory
 - Points system, when the game ends
 - I suggest to add comments where we "used" AI. Like sessions and such.
   Things we didn't cover in course
 - Make a restart to the game - optional
 - comments on all code - optional
 - CSS - optional
 - Write logic of the game - in a separate (from html and server) file
 - Ask Sara about "Show options" button





TO-DO:

 - Add pictures - optional
 - Write note that explains the code (ReadMe) - Sara asked to do
